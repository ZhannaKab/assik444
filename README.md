Vertex-Based Graph Algorithms in Java

This project implements graph algorithms Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Dijkstra's Algorithm on an edge-weighted graph using Vertex objects instead of Edge objects, as per assignment requirements.

ðŸ“Œ Project Structure

Vertex.java: Represents a graph vertex with adjacent vertices and edge weights.
WeightedGraph.java: Handles graph structure using vertices and their connections.
Search.java: Abstract base class for graph traversal.
BreadthFirstSearch.java: Implements BFS algorithm.
DijkstraSearch.java: Implements Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.
Main.java: Demonstrates example usage of the graph and both algorithms.
ðŸ§  Key Concepts

Generic Vertex: Each Vertex<V> holds data and its weighted adjacent vertices.
Graph Representation: Graph is built with a Map<Vertex, List<Vertex>> and weighted edges are stored within the Vertex itself.
Separation of Concerns: Each class has a clear, single responsibility.
âœ… How to Run

Compile all .java files.
Run Main.java.
Output will display paths found by BFS and Dijkstra algorithms.
ðŸ”„ Example Output

BFS: [A, B, C, D] Dijkstra: [A, B, C, D]

(Output depends on actual edge weights and structure.)

ðŸ’¡ Note

This implementation avoids the use of Edge class and instead focuses on building logic around Vertex objects directly, as required by the assignment.
